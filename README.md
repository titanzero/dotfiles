## Welcome to the wasted lands of dotfiles ðŸ”¥
---

That's a kindly reminder to my future self, in case you decided to format
(again) your laptop.

Let's start with the basic, to achieve a minimum working environment:
- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Install nvim [\*1](#notes)
- Clone repo to ~/.dotfiles 


### Notes:
\*1: If you have macOS 10.15+ and neovim from homebrew is still at
version < 0.5, then you have to install using --HEAD option. That's because of
a problem when loading help files.
